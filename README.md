# Introduction
This repository provides two R code in R-markdown format, designed to be run in the R-studio enviornment. The datasets is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/heart-disease-patients/data).

These models focus on utilizing machine learning techniques to optimize heart patient strategies based on individual characteristics. The main contributions are fulfilling the objective of grouping patients by their characteristics and using regularization methods to identify the key factors affecting patients' maximum heart rate within these groups. The selected factors assist in alleviating disease screening pressures, and the simplified predictions further reduce monitoring expenditures.

# Remarks
- Considering data ethics and privacy, patient information has been anonymized.
- Some of the packages used are not included by default in RStudio and require manual installation.
- The current dataset contains only 303 patients, which may lead to potential overestimation. Expanding the dataset is required.
